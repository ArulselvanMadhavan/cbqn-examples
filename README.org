* About the project
This project aims to visualize data movement involved in communication collectives.
As a first step, it shows how an all-reduce algorithm might work in a 2D HyperX topology
* Install setup
#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash
git clone git@github.com:dzaima/CBQN.git
cd CBQN/
make clean
make o3n CC=clang CXX=clang++ FFI=0
#+end_src
* Run BQN
#+begin_src bash
  <path_to_cbqn_binary> hyperx_raylib.bqn
#+end_src
* Demo
#+CAPTION: Watch demo of all-reduce in a 2D hyperX
