* About the project
This project aims to visualize data movement involved in communication collectives.
As a first step, it shows how an all-reduce algorithm might work in a 2D HyperX topology
* Install setup
#+begin_src bash

* Run BQN
#+begin_src bash
  <path_to_cbqn_binary> hyperx_raylib.bqn
#+end_src
